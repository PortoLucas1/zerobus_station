# Virtual Environment Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Installed

Your `.venv` virtual environment has been created and configured with all necessary dependencies:

- **FastAPI** (v0.124.4) - Web framework
- **Uvicorn** (v0.38.0) - ASGI server
- **Python-dotenv** (v1.2.1) - Environment variable management
- **Databricks-zerobus-ingest-sdk** (v0.2.0) - Databricks Zerobus Ingest SDK
  - Includes: grpcio, protobuf, requests
- **Build tools** - For creating wheel files

## 🚀 How to Use

### Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Run your FastAPI application:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### Deactivate when done:
```bash
deactivate
```

## ✅ Databricks SDK Installed

Using the official **databricks-zerobus-ingest-sdk v0.2.0** from PyPI.

This SDK includes all necessary dependencies for working with Databricks Zerobus:
- gRPC support for efficient streaming
- Protocol Buffers for data serialization
- HTTP client support

## 📦 Updated Files

I've updated these files to work with available packages:
- `requirements.txt` - Now references PyPI versions
- `pyproject.toml` - Removed local wheel file reference

## 🛠️ Additional Tools Installed

- **uv** - Modern Python package manager (installed at `~/.local/bin/uv`)
- **build** - For creating wheel files from your project

## 🔨 Build Your Project as a Wheel

If you want to distribute your zerobus-station project:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m build --wheel
```

The wheel will be created in the `dist/` directory.
